# FiniteStateMachine-In-C

This is how to implement the code in your project:
Let us assume we are working on an Embedded System for robotic arm movement and we wish to add a “State_Moving” state to our system.
 The characteristics of state are the flowing: 
-It has an entering action, and that action takes three entering parameters (integers) representing the direction of moving
-It has a looping action that check for multiples of condition to determine whether to enter a new sate or stay into the current state
-It has an exiting action a sound or something

STEP 1 : create State_Moving.c and State_Moving.h in which we define the four functions State_ Moving _Enter, State_ Moving _ Update, State_ Moving _ Output and
